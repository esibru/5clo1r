## Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more—over the internet ("the cloud"). It enables organizations and individuals to access and manage resources on-demand, without the need for owning physical infrastructure. This approach offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, making it a cornerstone of modern IT solutions.
